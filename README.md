## Project Description
Search a list of employee directory by name, email, or job title and
add or update the employees.

## data.json
Uses json file for populating and filtering table based on search by either name, email, or job-type.

## How I built this
• designed a layout first with a banner, and an initial search input
• focused on basic skeleton first to get some elements up like the input field
• I knew this app tested CRUD functionality and a todo app would be my best resource
• the biggest challenge was to work with multiple inputs where as in a todo you work with one input field
• edit functionality was the blocker for me, It took most of my time along with CSS to make it mobile first
• decided to bootstrap later on for simplicity over flexbox
• I searched how to look up event handler functions, form handlers, and watched a tutorial for the edit functionality
• As far as functionality, I worked on this piece by piece, starting off with adding (create) functionality first, then filtering and finally editing
