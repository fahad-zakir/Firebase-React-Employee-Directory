## data-info

## How I built this
I designed a form layout first, with a banner, and a search input
I had to envision and plan the appearance of it
First focused on basic skeleton, to get some elements up like the input field
I knew this app would test crud functionality and todo app was my best resource
The biggest challenge was to work with multiple inputs, where as in a todo you work with one input
Edit functionality was the blocker for me, It took most of my time along with CSS
I did most of the css first, deciding to go with flex box, but later changed it to bootstrap for simplicity
I searched how to look up common handlers, form handlers, and watched a tutorial for the edit functionality, syntax lookup
I worked on this piece by piece, first by working with adding an employee, than searching and finally edit
